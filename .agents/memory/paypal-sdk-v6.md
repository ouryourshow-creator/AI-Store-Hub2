name: PayPal JavaScript SDK v6
description: PayPal v6 checkout and card-field integration constraints verified against current SDK documentation.
---

PayPal JavaScript SDK v6 uses the core Web SDK URL and payment sessions instead of the legacy `sdk/js` loader, `Buttons`, or `CardFields` APIs. The current Card Fields API hosts number, expiry, and CVV components; cardholder name is supplied through the session submit options rather than a hosted name component. Standalone guest card checkout uses the basic-card custom element and the guest payment session.

**Why:** The v5 and v6 APIs expose similar concepts with different initialization, eligibility, callback, and component contracts; mixing them causes checkout controls to appear unavailable or fail at runtime.

**How to apply:** Load v6 components explicitly, check `findEligibleMethods` for `paypal`, `advanced_cards`, and `card`, return `{ orderId }` from the frontend order callback, and keep order creation/capture and secrets on the backend.

The preview workflow and published deployment are separate runtimes. Production PayPal routes and diagnostics do not change until the updated project is published; verify preview routes locally before asking the owner to publish.

**Why:** A production config probe can still show the previous build even when the preview has the corrected route and environment wiring.

**How to apply:** Treat production endpoint results as stale until a publish completes successfully, then recheck the production config endpoint without exposing the client secret.

The canonical Neon order table must contain the PayPal order/capture columns before any server code selects from it; otherwise the shared local-order idempotency lookup fails before PayPal is contacted.

**Why:** PayPal and card checkout both depend on the same local order creation endpoint, so a missing nullable payment column breaks both methods even when SDK eligibility succeeds.

**How to apply:** Keep the additive PayPal schema migration applied to the canonical development database, then publish through the normal production schema process without replacing or resetting existing order data.
